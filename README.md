# A/B Testing for Website Optimization

## Overview
This project leverages A/B testing to identify effective strategies for optimizing a website's performance. Through controlled experimentation, we analyze different versions of a web page to determine which changes can positively impact user behavior and website metrics such as click-through rates (CTR), conversions, and engagement.

## Objective
The primary goal is to use A/B testing methodologies to evaluate the impact of various design and content changes on user behavior, thus helping the website improve its key performance indicators (KPIs) and overall user experience.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes historical data on website visitors, their interactions with different versions of the webpage, and conversion rates. This dataset was either generated or sourced from public data repositories.

**Dataset Features:**
- **User ID**: Unique identifier for each user
- **Variant**: The version of the webpage presented to the user (e.g., Control, Variant A, Variant B)
- **Page Views**: Number of pages viewed in a session
- **Time on Page**: Duration of time spent on the page
- **Conversions**: Whether the user completed a conversion goal
- **Click-through Rate (CTR)**: Ratio of users who clicked on a call-to-action (CTA) element

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis, including handling missing values and transforming categorical variables.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understanding data distributions, trends, and insights about user behaviors across different webpage versions.
3. **A/B Test Setup**:
   - Setting up hypotheses to test variations (null and alternative hypotheses).
   - Defining metrics such as CTR, conversion rate, and time on page.
4. **Statistical Testing**: Using statistical tests (e.g., t-tests, chi-squared tests) to evaluate if observed differences are statistically significant.
5. **Result Interpretation**: Analyzing the outcomes to draw meaningful insights and understand the impact of changes on user behavior.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Python** for data manipulation and statistical analysis
- **Pandas** and **NumPy** for data processing
- **SciPy** and **StatsModels** for statistical testing
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for data visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook** for organizing the analysis workflow

## Results
Our A/B testing results indicate that:
- **Version A** of the webpage resulted in a higher conversion rate compared to the control version, showing statistical significance at the 95% confidence level.
- **Version B** did not yield statistically significant improvements, suggesting no notable difference from the control.

## Conclusion
Based on the findings, **Version A** of the webpage is recommended for deployment, as it has shown a positive impact on conversions. This analysis highlights the value of A/B testing in making data-driven decisions for website optimization.

## Future Work
- Implement multi-armed bandit algorithms for continuous A/B testing.
- Test additional variants with modified layouts and content to further optimize the user experience.
- Integrate machine learning models to predict user behavior and personalize content dynamically.
